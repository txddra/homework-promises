//1:
//Write a function compareToTen that takes a number, num as an argument and returns a Promise that tests if the value of num is less than or greater than the value 10.
// if number is greater or equal it should resolve  with a string and log for example, if num = 20 it should say '20 is greater than or equal to 10, resolved!'
// if num is less than 10 then it should reject and log for example '5 is less than 10, error!'
// create a variable randomNum that creates a random number between 1 and 20
// use it as your argument to invoke your compareToTen function

const compareToTen = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {

  let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1
  let val = randomNum >= 10;
  if (!val) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject(`${randomNum} is less than 10, error!`)
    }, 2000)
  } else if (val) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(randomNum)
      }, 2000)

  }

})

// return new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
//   se if(num => 10 ){
//     resolve(randomNum)
//   }

// })
// }
compareToTen.then((data) => {
  console.log(`${data} is greater than or equal to 10, resolved!`)
  // let x = randomNum 
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error)
})


//2.
// create a global variable called order. It will hold a string with whatever drink you want to order, for example, a 'Slurpee'
//create a promise called drink
// inside your promise:
// first log 'I'll be right back with your <order variable>'.
const order = "Slurpee";

const orderCannotBeFilled = false;

const drink = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  if (!orderCannotBeFilled) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject(`Sorry we are all out of ${order}`)
    }, 2000)
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(order)
    }, 4000)
  }

})

drink.then((order) => {
  console.log(`I'll be right back with your ${order}`)
}).catch((err)=>{
   console.log(err)
})

// next create another boolean variable, orderCannotBeFilled. Set it to false
// when order is orderCannotBeFilled is true, promise should reject after 2 seconds with a message,
// 'Sorry we are all out of <whatever the order is>' (not hard coded order)
// otherwise resolve the order after 4 seconds saying 'Server returns: 'Here is your <whatever the order is>'

// Now consume the promise
// When the order resolves, it should log 'Server Returns:' and the resolve message.
// Handle the catch. It should log 'Sorry we are all out of <whatever the order is>'

// Test by changing the value of orderCannotBeFilled between true and false

// SAMPLE OUTPUT:
// resolve out put should be
// Server says: "I'll be right back with your Slurpee"
// Server returns: "Here is your Slurpee".

// OR
// reject output in terminal should be
// Server says: "I'll be right back with your Slurpee"
// Sever returns: "Sorry, We are all out of Slurpee"

//3.CHAIN
//Write two separate functions that return promises
// The first function, makeAllCaps(), will take in an array of words and capitalize them.
//the second function, sortWords(), will sort the words in alphabetical order.
//If the array contains anything but strings, it should throw an error.
// Test the functions separately
// Then test what happens if you chain the 2 functions on a successful array

const arrayOfWords = ['cucumber', 'tomatos', 'avocado']; //returns ['CUCUMBER','TOMATOES','AVOCADO']
const complicatedArray = ['cucumber', 44, true]; //returns "Error Not All Items are strings"

//4.
// a. Create a variable, totalSales that creates a promise.
// b. Within the promise create a reject handler for errors and a resolve handler that resolves a copy of the array that is inside the json object.
// c. Call or rather consume your totalSales promise
// d. Use your thenable to log the data for all the companies in the Legal industry
// e. pass the data for all the companies in the Legal industry to the next thenable
// f. Chain again and find all the names of the people in the legal industry and log those names in a string: "Contacts from the legal profession:" + list all of the names
// g. In that same thenable return 30% of each of the sales and pass the value to the next thenable
// h. Add all of the sales totals together and return a string saying: "Total sales for everyone from the Legal profession after taxes is $30000" if the value of the added sales is 30000

// 5. Based on given athlets array
//a.  Write a function called playerFunction that returns a promise which copies the array into a new array called 'playerArr'.
// Make sure your function is re-useable so no hard coded values.
//b. Now invoke the function
// loop through the function using array method and Place a key value pair into each object based on the player's position.
//If the position is guard then add sport:'basketball'
// If the position is quarterback add sport:'football'
// Use a ternary to solve this.
// Note: There can only be two sports either football or basketball and only two positions guard and quarterback
//c.
// Log (console.log) the whole array with the sport added for each object. Preface the list with a 'Sport added: ' string.
// console.log('---------') to separate a section.
//d.
// In your next thenable, Console.log a string like the example below for each player:
// 'Tom Bradshaw plays football and is a quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers'
// Only choose the players who play football and use deconstruction and the ternary operator to complete this piece
//e. In the next thenable, console.log the original array to show it has not been mutated
//f. Be sure to include you Promise Error Handling using the catch
